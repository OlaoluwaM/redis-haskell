# Ephemeral Notes and Jottings

I'd be interested in switching over redis-haskell to using effectful over mtl

We want and RDB Val type that is only made up of ints and strings, not RDBVal, leave out floats for now

Look to removing FormatSpec in favor of just IntegrationSpec

Make UsedMem a Word, not Int
